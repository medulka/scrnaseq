## Introduction

The **nf-core/scrnaseq** is a bioinformatics best-practise analysis pipeline for transciptomic data of single-cell RNAs. The pipeline creates count matrices from FASTQ sequence reads. It is suitable for droplets-based sequencing technologies.
The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io), a workflow tool to run tasks across multiple compute infrastructures in a very portable manner. It comes with docker containers making installation trivial and results highly reproducible.

On release, automated continuous integration tests run the pipeline on a full-sized dataset on the AWS cloud infrastructure. This ensures that the pipeline runs on AWS, has sensible resource allocation defaults set to run on real-world datasets, and permits the persistent storage of results to benchmark between pipeline releases and other analysis sources. The results obtained from the full-sized test can be viewed on the [nf-core website](https://nf-co.re/scrnaseq/results).

## Pipeline summary

This is a community effort in building a pipeline capable to support:

* Alevin + AlevinQC
* STARSolo
* Kallisto + BUStools

## Documentation

The nf-core/scrnaseq pipeline comes with documentation about the pipeline [usage](https://nf-co.re/scrnaseq/usage), [parameters](https://nf-co.re/scrnaseq/parameters) and [output](https://nf-co.re/scrnaseq/output).

## Quick Start

1. Install [`Nextflow`](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/getstarted.html#installation) (`>=21.10.3`)

2. Install any of [`Docker`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/), [`Singularity`](https://www.sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/), [`Podman`](https://podman.io/), [`Shifter`](https://nersc.gitlab.io/development/shifter/how-to-use/) or [`Charliecloud`](https://hpc.github.io/charliecloud/) for full pipeline reproducibility _(please only use [`Conda`](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) as a last resort; see [docs](https://nf-co.re/usage/configuration#basic-configuration-profiles))_

3. Download the pipeline and test it on a minimal dataset with a single command:

    ```console
    nextflow run nf-core/scrnaseq -profile test,YOURPROFILE
    ```

    Note that some form of configuration will be needed so that Nextflow knows how to fetch the required software. This is usually done in the form of a config profile (`YOURPROFILE` in the example command above). You can chain multiple config profiles in a comma-separated string.

    > * The pipeline comes with config profiles called `docker`, `singularity`, `podman`, `shifter`, `charliecloud` and `conda` which instruct the pipeline to use the named tool for software management. For example, `-profile test,docker`.
    > * Please check [nf-core/configs](https://github.com/nf-core/configs#documentation) to see if a custom config file to run nf-core pipelines already exists for your Institute. If so, you can simply use `-profile <institute>` in your command. This will enable either `docker` or `singularity` and set the appropriate execution settings for your local compute environment.
    > * If you are using `singularity` and are persistently observing issues downloading Singularity images directly due to timeout or network issues, then you can use the `--singularity_pull_docker_container` parameter to pull and convert the Docker image instead. Alternatively, you can use the [`nf-core download`](https://nf-co.re/tools/#downloading-pipelines-for-offline-use) command to download images first, before running the pipeline. Setting the [`NXF_SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR` or `singularity.cacheDir`](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/singularity.html?#singularity-docker-hub) Nextflow options enables you to store and re-use the images from a central location for future pipeline runs.
    > * If you are using `conda`, it is highly recommended to use the [`NXF_CONDA_CACHEDIR` or `conda.cacheDir`](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/conda.html) settings to store the environments in a central location for future pipeline runs.

4. Start running your own analysis!

    ```console
    nextflow run nf-core/scrnaseq -profile <docker/singularity/podman/shifter/charliecloud/conda/institute> --input samplesheet.csv --genome_fasta GRCm38.p6.genome.chr19.fa --gtf gencode.vM19.annotation.chr19.gtf --protocol 10XV2
    ```

## Credits

The `nf-core/scrnaseq` was initiated by [Peter J. Bailey](https://github.com/PeterBailey) (Salmon Alevin, AlevinQC) with major contributions from [Olga Botvinnik](https://github.com/olgabot) (STARsolo, Testdata) and [Alex Peltzer](https://github.com/apeltzer) (Kallisto/BusTools workflow).

We thank the following people for their extensive assistance in the development of this pipeline:

* @KevinMenden
* @ggabernet
* @FloWuenne

## Contributions and Support

If you would like to contribute to this pipeline, please see the [contributing guidelines](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Citations

If you use  nf-core/scrnaseq for your analysis, please cite it using the following doi: [10.5281/zenodo.3568187](https://doi.org/10.5281/10.5281/zenodo.3568187)

The basic benchmarks that were used as motivation for incorporating the three available modular workflows can be found in [this publication](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/673285v2).

We offer all three paths for the processing of scRNAseq data so it remains up to the user to decide which pipeline workflow is chosen for a particular analysis question.

An extensive list of references for the tools used by the pipeline can be found in the [`CITATIONS.md`](CITATIONS.md) file.
